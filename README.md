# WarGame-third-version-0.0.4-
2d war game single player

Hi !

Today, I publish on GitHub the version 0.0.4 of "WarGame". In this version, you can find a second level and I corrected a lot of bugs. You can find the other versions on my account. I apologize that the code is in french but I started to write my game in french so I continue to give french names at my variables. Nevertheless, from now, when I want to code a new game, all the names of functions, classes and variables are in english (I wrote the Boby Wasp's code only in english. https://github.com/EdouardVincent/Boby-WaspV2).
I am sorry too for the names of the images and songs (OIP) but i don't why but the images and songs don't work when I put another name. 
Do not hesitate to check my code and try to run it, I work with the version 3.9.5 of python on windows and Thonny Python IDLE on rpi4, my version of pygame is the 2.0.1.

See you later !
